# JupyterNotebookProofOfConcept
Learning how to use, and trying to render x3d files in Jupyter

## Running Jupyter Notebook Locally
1. Run `pip -V` on the command line.  
  My results are `pip 19.2.3 from c:\python38\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.8)`  
  You may have a newer version, but as long as it dosen't say python 2.X these direction should still work
1. If you computer says unknown command then Install python3
1. Install jupyter notebook via the pip command `pip install notebook`
1. cd your terminal into your JupyterNotebookProofOfConcept\JupyterNotebook folder
1. run `jupyter notebook` in your terminal
1. This should run jupyter notebook and open a browser to http://localhost:8888/tree
1. Now Open the "Hello World Example.ipynb" file.
